# My Blog
[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) build hosted on [Gitpages](https://pages.github.com/). This site makes use of a number of [gatsby-plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-markdown-pages/) to render markdown files as site pages, which makes adding blog posts really easy. 

Eventually I may add [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) configuration, though as of right now I prefer writing markdown in VSCode vs. the Netlify text editor.
